Building ML algorithms

With this I am trying to implement different Machine Learning Algorithms without using the available Machine Learning libraries in python. I will be using Python to build the code and will try to explain the algorithms in the simplest way.

I will be adding algorithms as and when I implement. You can find the list below:-

Hope I can contribute to the community!!!
