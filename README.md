# ML
Building ML algorithms

With this I am trying to implement different Machine Learning Algorithms without using the available Machine Learning libraries in python. I will be using Python to build the code and will try to explain the algorithms in the simplest way.

I will be adding algorithms as and when I implement. You can find the list below:-

Hope I can contribute to the community!!!

| Algorithm | Description | Link 
| --- | --- | --- 
| LDA/Multivariate Gaussian | Using MNIST Digits Dataset | [Handwritten Digit Recognition](https://github.com/akshitbhatnagar2008/ML/blob/master/Handwritten%20digit%20recognition1.ipynb)
| Naive Bayes Classifier | Text Classification | [Text Classification](https://github.com/akshitbhatnagar2008/ML/blob/master/MutinomialNB.pdf)

I have also added some models which were implemented using sklearn library.
