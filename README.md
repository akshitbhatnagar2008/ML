# ML
Building ML algorithms

With this I am trying to implement different Machine Learning Algorithms without using the available Machine Learning libraries in python. I will be using Python to build the code and will try to explain the algorithms in the simplest way.

I will be adding algorithms as when I come up with those. You can find the list below:-


Rendered table with varied cell width

Formatting content within your table

You can use formatting such as links, inline code blocks, and text styling within your table:

| Algorithm | Description | Link 
| --- | --- | --- 
| LDA/Multivariate Gaussian | Using MNIST Digits Dataset | https://github.com/akshitbhatnagar2008/ML/blob/master/Handwritten%20digit%20recognition1.ipynb
